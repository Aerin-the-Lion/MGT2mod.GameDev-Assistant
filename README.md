# GameDev Assistant for Mad Games Tycoon 2(Mod)

## Motivation for Creating the Mod:
This mod was inspired by "Mad Games Tycoon 2 - EzGameDev" by Asventi.

While similar to the "EzGameDev" mod, this mod was created for the following reasons and purposes:

- Compiled with BepInEx 5 due to version differences causing many users to be unable to use the mod.
- Unique improvements and new features as an "Assistant" - This mod includes unique - functionalities and enhancements not found in "EzGameDev," enhancing user experience and enabling richer gameplay.

Although this is the background, I hope you will give it a try.

## How to Use:

This MOD operates almost identically to "EzGameDev."
It categorizes and simplifies optimization for Genre, Theme (Topic), Age Target Group, Design Focus, Design Direction, Work Priorities, etc., through color-coding.

- Additionally, as a unique improvement, an "Assist Button" has been added.
- "Assist Button" allows you to create a fully automated and randomly optimized game with just one click.
- Regarding color-coding, considering user's color perception, it has been made customizable via a dropdown list.
- For Config settings, press [F1], open "GameDev Assistant (ver)," and toggle buttons to customize as you like.
